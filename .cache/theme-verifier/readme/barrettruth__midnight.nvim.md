## Motivation

I find existing colorschemes to generally be excessively colorful and
distracting rather than informative. I wrote midnight.nvim to focus on code
structure, specifically for competitive programming and workplace software
development environments. I included highlighting of constants (e.g. strings,
numbers, booleans) and language keywords to emphasize the maximally important
aspects of code and its structure, respectively.
