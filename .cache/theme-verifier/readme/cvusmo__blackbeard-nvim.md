## Features

- **Dark and Light Themes**: Inspired by popular colorschemes like Gruvbox, Kanagawa, TokyoNight, and Cyberdream.
- **System-Wide Integration**: Synchronizes Neovim, Alacritty, and GTK themes for a unified look across your desktop environment.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Use commands to switch themes, set Alacritty font sizes, and configure GTK icon themes.
- **Plugin Support**: Integrates with popular plugins such as Telescope, LSP, and more.
- **User-Friendly Installation**: Installs GTK themes to `~/.local/share/themes/` by default, with an option for system-wide installation.
- **Command-Driven Workflow**: Provides a powerful `:Blackbeard` command to manage themes, font sizes, icon themes, and external components like DWM and Hyprland.

### Commands

The `:Blackbeard` command is the primary way to interact with the plugin. Below is a table of all available commands and their descriptions:

## Installation

# :black_heart: Blackbeard-nvim Plugin Update: Easy Installation with Lazy.nvim

Hey everyone! I’ve been working on my dotfiles and recently branched off my `blackbeard-nvim` plugin to add some cool features. It’s a simple Neovim plugin for toggling between dark and light themes, and it’s super easy to install using Lazy.nvim (note: this doesn’t work with Packer). Follow the steps below to get started! :rocket:

## Installation Instructions

1. **Visit the GitHub Repository**  
   Head over to the `blackbeard-nvim` repository:  
   [https://github.com/cvusmo/blackbeard-nvim](https://github.com/cvusmo/blackbeard-nvim)

2. **Add the Plugin to Your Neovim Config**  
   Open your Neovim configuration directory (usually `~/.config/nvim/`). If you don’t already have a `plugins` directory for Lazy.nvim, create one:  

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins
```

3.Create or Edit the Plugin File
Create (or edit) a file named blackbeard.lua in the ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/ directory:  
bash

touch ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/blackbeard.lua

4. Add the Plugin Configuration
Copy the following Lua code into ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/blackbeard.lua. This sets up the plugin with the default dark theme and adds a keybinding to toggle between dark and light themes:  

``` lua
-- ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/blackbeard.lua

return {
  "cvusmo-dev/blackbeard-nvim",
  lazy = false,
  config = function()
    require("blackbeard").setup({
      theme = "dark",
      font_size = 26,
    })
  end,
}
```

5. Sync Plugins with Lazy.nvim
Open Neovim and run the following command to install the plugin:  

```
:Lazy sync
```

6. This will download and install blackbeard-nvim from the master branch.
Test the Plugin  

    Restart Neovim 
    Press <leader>tt (e.g., if your leader key is the default \, this would be \tt) to toggle between the dark and light themes.  
    Or enter command :Blackbeard dark OR :Blackbeard light
    You should see your Neovim colorscheme switch between the two themes!

Thank you to all who have created colorschmes for neovim. These four have been some of my favorites to use and their code was instrumental in setting up my own colorscheme. Thank you again!
